### Different Data Types in the LC Case Study

1. **Text Data**
    - **Example:** Customer feedback left on the website, emails, and comments about order and delivery times. This data is usually unstructured and consists of sentences or paragraphs of text.

2. **Numerical Data**
    - **Example:** Total quarterly sales figures, the number of customer queries, and discounts or promotions applied to products. This data is often used for calculations, reporting, and analytics.

3. **Date/Time Data**
    - **Example:** Dates of customer orders, delivery dates, and dates when promotions are applied. This data is important for tracking timelines and scheduling.

4. **Categorical Data**
    - **Example:** Types of electrical equipment (e.g., residential vs. industrial), categories of customer feedback (e.g., delivery time, product quality), and customer segments (e.g., wholesalers, individual customers).

5. **Boolean Data**
    - **Example:** Whether a customer is eligible for a promotion, whether a product is in stock, and whether a service is available in a certain location. This data is used for decision-making processes.

6. **Currency Data**
    - **Example:** Prices of electrical equipment and services, total purchase amounts, and discounts. This data is crucial for financial transactions and accounting.

### Data Validation Checks for Online Purchase Process

1. **Required Field Validation**
    - **Check:** Ensure that all mandatory fields (e.g., customer name, billing address, payment details) are filled out before the form can be submitted.
    - **Example:** A purchase cannot be completed unless the user provides their shipping address.

2. **Data Type Validation**
    - **Check:** Ensure that the input matches the expected data type (e.g., text, number, date).
    - **Example:** The credit card number field should only accept numerical data.

3. **Format Validation**
    - **Check:** Ensure that the data entered follows a specific format (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
    - **Example:** An email address should follow the format `example@domain.com`.

4. **Range Validation**
    - **Check:** Ensure that numerical data falls within a specified range.
    - **Example:** The quantity of items purchased should be greater than zero and within the stock limit.

5. **Uniqueness Validation**
    - **Check:** Ensure that certain fields contain unique values (e.g., order ID, email address).
    - **Example:** The order ID should be unique and not duplicated in the system.

6. **Consistency Validation**
    - **Check:** Ensure that related fields contain consistent data.
    - **Example:** The billing address should match the address associated with the payment method.

7. **Length Validation**
    - **Check:** Ensure that the input data does not exceed or fall below a certain number of characters.
    - **Example:** The credit card number should have exactly 16 digits.

8. **Logical Validation**
    - **Check:** Ensure that the input data makes sense in context.
    - **Example:** The delivery date should not be set earlier than the current date or beyond a reasonable future period.

9. **Cross-field Validation**
    - **Check:** Ensure that the values of two or more fields are logically compatible.
    - **Example:** If a customer selects "express shipping," the system should check that their location is eligible for this option.

These validation checks are crucial to ensure the integrity of the data collected during the online purchase process and to provide a seamless user experience.
