                    <li>
                        <span class="highlight">Baseball Cap:</span> 
                        The classic baseball cap features a rounded
                        crown and a stiff peak brim. It's versatile and suitable
                        for casual wear, sports, and outdoor activities. Baseball
                        caps often have adjustable straps at the back for a
                        customized fit.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span class="highlight">Snapback Cap:</span>
                        A snapback cap is characterized by its adjustable snap closure at the back, which allows for a
                        comfortable fit. It typically has a flat brim and a structured crown. Snapbacks are popular in
                        streetwear fashion and can feature various logos and designs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="highlight">Trucker Cap:</span>
                        Trucker caps have a distinctive mesh panel at the back, which provides ventilation. The front panels
                        are usually made of foam and may feature logos or designs. Originally worn by truck drivers, they
                        have become a trendy choice for casual and outdoor wear.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="highlight">Bucket Hat:</span>
                        Bucket hats have a wide, downward-sloping brim and a soft, unstructured crown. They are made from
                        materials like cotton, denim, or nylon, offering sun protection and a laid-back style. Bucket hats
                        have gained popularity in streetwear and casual fashion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="highlight">Beanie:</span>
                        Unlike traditional caps, beanies are knitted or woven hats that fit snugly on the head. They are
                        typically made of wool, cotton, or acrylic, providing warmth and comfort. Beanies come in various
                        styles, including cuffed, slouchy, and pom-pom beanies, making them versatile for different looks
                        and seasons.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Each of these cap styles offers unique features and aesthetics,
                    catering to different preferences and occasions. Whether you're
                    into sports, streetwear, or simply looking to add a stylish
                    accessory to your outfit, there's a cap style to match your taste.
