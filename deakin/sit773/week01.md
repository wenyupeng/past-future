- Systems architect:
  - creates designs of systems that meet the requirements and constraints identified by the systems analyst
  - works primarily on tasks associated with the design phase
  - has responsibility for the high-level technical aspects of the software system, such as adherence to technical standards and the selection of technologies and processes.
- Software engineer:
  - performs the tasks required to implement software systems
  - works primarily in the implementation phase
  - writes the code that implements features of the system as well as performs technical tasks that support the installation of the system and its continued operation
  - works with testers who ensure that the implemented system behaves as intended.
- Support technician:
  - is responsible for maintaining the operation of the system once it is in use
  - works during the maintenance phase
  - provides technical activities specific to the system as well as customer-facing activities such as technical support.


# Pain points
The challenges and problems your users are facing are known as pain points. Before you even start thinking about developing software, you need to understand what the pain points are.
An example of a pain point for a potential client could be that they only have paper records of what their customers have purchased so it’s difficult to determine what customers have purchased in the past.

# Problem domain
The constraints and environment, or context, that your solution will need to operate in are referred to as problem domain or problem space. It is essential to understand the problem domain to develop a useful solution.

# Solution domain
A solution domain or solution space describes the process by which the solution is constructed, the environment in which it operates and the functions of the solution itself.


# Problem statement
The problem statement is a concise, clear and precise definition of the problem that your project intends to address by building a software system.

Your problem statement should outline the pain points of the current situation and explain why they matter and are worth solving.

The statement should be straightforward and compelling to get buy-in from your stakeholders.


- How do you arrive at your problem statement?
1. Talk to your stakeholders to determine what they identify as problems, ie pain points and potential opportunities. Be aware that individual stakeholders can have a limited perspective of the problems they are facing, so try to collect information from as many different stakeholders as possible.
2. Analyse these problems, making sure that they are real and important from the customer perspective. Stakeholders can misunderstand problems and their causes; you need to ensure that their concerns are accurate.
3. Identify the root causes of these problems. Often the symptoms are far removed from the causes and thorough examination is required to identify the source of problems.
4. Know your audience, the stakeholders who will read your statement. You need to be able to convince them that the problem has to be solved, which will be easier if you understand their specific concerns and can communicate in language that they understand.
5. Write your problem statement. Include the key details of the problem. Use a professional style and tone and seek feedback from the project manager before sharing the statement with stakeholders.

# An example problem statement
The Distillery, a local beverage company, wishes to roster all of their staff to appropriate shifts without bias, while at the same time ensuring that each staff member is allocated enough hours in order to coincide with their individual preferences.

As it stands, rosters are manually worked out, based on preference sheets that each employee fills out on a fortnightly basis.

This system produces too much paperwork and sometimes, employees fail to submit their preference sheets, which leaves the shift manager having to contact those employees in order to determine what shifts they want.

This process poses other problems, like the fact that at the end of every working fortnight, the shift manager has to manually calculate all of the hours and the pay run for each employee, which takes time and can lead to mistakes.

Shifts is a software system which aims to automate staff rostering and payroll.

Each employee will have an account for Shifts, in which they will specify their preferred shifts, and the software will automatically delegate shifts and populate a full working roster.

Shifts will also calculate and pay each employee based on the shifts that they have been assigned.

# Identifying pain points
## Listening and observing
It is usually recommended to work in a team during this phase, to make sure that you identify the right problem without any personal bias or expectations that might affect individuals’ judgement and understanding of the problem.

After you and your team have talked to people and observed processes, you should start collecting and consolidating, in one place, the key observations that each team member has made.
## Collating notes
A good way to do this is to get every team member to write their observations on sticky notes or cards and put it on a white board. Digital collaboration tools can also be used to share notes.

Observations need to be grouped based on the aspect of the problem they are related to, their position in the related business processes, etc. This makes it easier for the team to see the full picture.
## Ranking pain points
Once you have captured all observations, it is time to rank them in order of priority.

Each team member votes for observations that represent a pain point that is important to address. Once the voting is done, you should be able to rank the observations based on number of votes received.
## Recording and sharing your findings
The last step is to write a list of high-priority pain points. Your team should then share the pain points they identified with the customer to make sure that the team’s understanding and perspective of the problem matches that of the customer.



# Analysing the domain
## Preparing a fishbone diagram
- Draw a line and state a concise problem definition at the end of it. This will be the spine.
- There are different factors for each problem. Some common factors are people, processes, equipment, materials, environment and management. Draw lines off the spine of the diagram for each factor and label each line; these will be the bones.
- Once the major factors have been identified, draw shorter lines coming off the bones of the diagram that denote the causes. If a cause is large or complex, then it could be broken down into sub-causes with lines off each cause line.
