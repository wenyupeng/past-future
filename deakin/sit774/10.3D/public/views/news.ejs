                            <p class="text-center">A large tree, its massive trunk splintered and roots partially
                                uprooted, has fallen across a residential house. The branches have shattered windows and
                                torn through the roof, causing significant structural damage. The weight of the tree has
                                crushed one side of the house, leaving the walls cracked and the roof caved in. Debris
                                is scattered across the yard, and the house is now partially buried under the tangled
                                mass of leaves, branches, and broken wood. The scene is one of chaos, with the tree
                                looming over the damaged home, emphasizing the sheer force of nature.</p>

                            <p class="text-center">The wooden structure of the house shows clear signs of decay, with
                                the once sturdy beams now soft and crumbling to the touch. The wood has darkened in
                                color, with patches of mold and mildew spreading across the surface. In some areas, the
                                wood is visibly warped and cracked, with sections flaking off and disintegrating into
                                dust. The corners and edges of the wooden planks have begun to rot away, leaving gaps
                                and exposing the inner layers. The smell of dampness and rot lingers in the air, and the
                                houseâ€™s framework appears weakened, as if it could give way at any moment.</p>

                            <p class="text-center">Termites have infested the wooden structures of the house, leaving
                                behind a trail of destruction. The wood appears hollowed out, with visible tunnels and
                                galleries carved through beams, floorboards, and walls. The once sturdy framework is now
                                brittle, crumbling at the slightest touch, and riddled with small holes. Piles of fine,
                                sawdust-like material known as frass can be found around the baseboards, a telltale sign
                                of their activity. In some areas, the damage is so severe that the wood has collapsed,
                                compromising the integrity of the house. The infestation has weakened the structure,
                                making it unsafe and requiring extensive repairs.</p>
