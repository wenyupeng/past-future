# Explain how inheritance and polymorphism are used in the solution.
In this task, three different types of transactions are inherited from Transaction class, which helps subclasses reduce code duplication. Subclasses can use the public fields and methods defined in the parent class, such as _executed, _reversed, Execute(), Rollback(), etc. And polymorphism makes design more efficient and flexible, like ExecuteTransaction(Transaction transaction).

# How can the one method perform any kind of transaction?
A method can declare a generic type as a parameter, and when the method is called, a specific subtype is passed, so that a method can perform any type of transaction.

# What changes would you need to make to the Bank to include a new transaction type?
Declare a new class that inherits from Transaction and then create objects from this class

# What are the advantages we get through inheritance?
We can gain many advantages through inheritance, and in my opinion, flexible design and reduced code duplication are the key advantages.

# What advantages does polymorphism provide?
Code reusability and flexibility and extensibility are the key advantages that polymorphism provides.
