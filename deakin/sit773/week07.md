# Software development lifecycles
## Predictive lifecycles
Predictive lifecycles are designed to follow a series of steps, or phases, where each phase, upon completion, provides the prerequisites for the next phase of the system’s development.

As an example, in a predictive lifecycle, the design and implementation of system functionality do not begin until the requirements have been identified and documented.

## Adaptive lifecycles
Adaptive lifecycles generally do not have a rigid set of steps or phases that need to be completed in sequence for a project to progress.

Due to the less rigid nature of adaptive SDLCs, some requirements are not well defined until late in the project.
Care needs to be taken to identify all high-level requirements at the start of the project, so that requirements discovered late in the project do not substantially alter the project’s direction at great cost.

## An ideal approach
Both predictive and adaptive lifecycles have strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, the success of a project is determined by being able to visualise and understand clear outcomes and deliverables for the project, which reflect the domain and business problem for which the system is being designed.
