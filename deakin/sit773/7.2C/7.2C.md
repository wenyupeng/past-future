Comparative Analysis:

Waterfall Model:

Characteristics: Linear and sequential; each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Advantages: Simple to understand and manage; well-suited for projects with well-defined requirements.
Disadvantages: Inflexible to changes; not ideal for complex or long-term projects.
Risks: High risk if requirements change late in the process.
Handling Changes: Changes are difficult to accommodate; may result in significant rework.
Parallel Development Model:

Characteristics: Divides the project into sub-projects that can be developed simultaneously.
Advantages: Shortens development time; efficient for large systems.
Disadvantages: Integration challenges; complex to manage.
Risks: Integration risks; potential for sub-project delays.
Handling Changes: More flexible than Waterfall but still challenging to manage mid-development changes.
Iterative Life Cycle:

Characteristics: Develops the system in iterations, refining the product with each cycle.
Advantages: Allows for feedback and improvements in each iteration; reduces risks.
Disadvantages: Requires careful planning; can be time-consuming.
Risks: Scope creep; potential for budget overruns.
Handling Changes: Changes can be incorporated in subsequent iterations, improving client satisfaction.
Evolutionary Prototyping:

Characteristics: Develops prototypes iteratively until the final system is built.
Advantages: Provides early visibility; allows for user feedback.
Disadvantages: May result in incomplete systems; high user expectations.
Risks: Users may mistake the prototype for the final product.
Handling Changes: Accommodates changes well through iterative prototyping, enhancing client satisfaction.
Throw-away Prototyping:

Characteristics: Builds a prototype to understand requirements, which is then discarded.
Advantages: Helps clarify requirements; reduces misunderstandings.
Disadvantages: Wasted effort on prototypes; not suitable for complex systems.
Risks: Potential loss of focus on final product requirements.
Handling Changes: Allows for changes early in the process, reducing risks later on.
Agile Development:

Characteristics: Focuses on iterative development with close collaboration with clients.
Advantages: Highly flexible; responsive to changes; high client satisfaction.
Disadvantages: Requires experienced team members; can lead to scope creep.
Risks: Lack of documentation; potential for project delays.
Handling Changes: Agile is designed to accommodate frequent changes, ensuring high client satisfaction and adaptability to evolving requirements.
