Most houses in Australia are made of wood, which can be easily damaged if not properly protected.
When a house is damaged, it is difficult to find a good electrician or carpenter to repair it. Because carpenters and electricians are busy, electricians on the market need to be contacted by the homeowner and booked by phone.
Before electricians and carpenters repair a house, they need to assess how much it will cost to repair the house and whether the homeowner can accept the price. If not, it will take a long time for the homeowner to find another electrician and carpenter.

### Pain Points

1. **Vulnerability of Wooden Houses**: Most houses in Australia are made of wood, which can be easily damaged if not properly maintained or protected.
2. **Difficulty in Finding Skilled Workers**: Homeowners find it challenging to locate reputable electricians and carpenters for repairs.
3. **High Demand and Low Availability**: Electricians and carpenters are often busy, making it difficult to book them for repairs promptly.
4. **Inefficient Booking Process**: The current process of contacting electricians and carpenters by phone is time-consuming and inefficient.
5. **Cost Assessment Delays**: Electricians and carpenters need to assess repair costs, and if the homeowner rejects the quote, it prolongs the process of finding another worker.

### Domain Analysis

1. **House Owner**: In Australia, wooden houses are prevalent, making them susceptible to damage from environmental 
   factors and general wear and tear.
2. **Service Providers**: The domain involves electricians and carpenters who provide repair and maintenance services for wooden houses.
3. **Booking and Communication**: The current method involves homeowners contacting service providers via phone, leading to delays and inefficiencies.
4. **Cost Assessment**: Repair workers need to provide cost estimates before commencing work, which can be a point of contention and delay if the homeowner finds the price unacceptable.

### Problem Statement

The primary issue facing homeowners in Australia is the challenge of efficiently and effectively repairing their wooden houses when they sustain damage. This difficulty stems from the scarcity and high demand for skilled electricians and carpenters, compounded by an inefficient booking and communication process that relies on phone calls. Furthermore, the necessity for electricians and carpenters to conduct cost assessments before starting repairs introduces additional delays, especially when homeowners reject initial quotes. This process is not only time-consuming but also frustrating for homeowners who need timely repairs to maintain the integrity of their wooden houses. Therefore, there is a need for a streamlined solution that simplifies the process of finding, booking, and negotiating with skilled repair workers.
