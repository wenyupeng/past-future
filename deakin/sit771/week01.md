computers are unintelligent; software empowers these machines to perform great tasks.
learning to program is an incredibly empowering skill and will give you the understanding you need to get computers to do whatever you want



When I write code, I learned the grammar first (C# requires a semicolon at the end). This task is mainly about how to prepare the environment. In order to do this job, I have to learn some concepts about the system environment.

when I use vs to run the code, it failed. I think system terminal can not run the code. So how to combine msys2 wit vs?

computer science continues to change and disrupt the world as the world rapidly evolves.

as the power of computers expands, their potential enables us to continually reinvent how many things function and perform.

Learning to program will help you understand how computers operate and will better equip you to grasp and envisage 
potential opportunities by harnessing the power of computers.

to store data more permanently you need to use a storage device such as a solid-state drive or hard disk.

output devices take digital information and turn it into something the user can perceive.

help you better understand Class/Object/....
1. Class, like a template, you can describe what you want to create, example:  you want to create a Person, firstly, you have to list the fields of Person, such as name, age, gender.... and some actions(methods), then you can get a Person class like this:
Class Person{
String name;
int age;
char gender;

void Sing(){}
void Swimming(){}
}
2. Object, by using the Person template, you can tell the computer that I want to use memory(heap) to new an object, after the computer allocate a memory address for you, you succeed in creat a object.
Person obj=new Person();
3. Variable, when we create an object, we usually use variable to record the address(actually, you can use anonymous object, like this `new Person()`, `new Person()` is an object without name), variable is stored in the stack. When we use variable to link a value, the variable is a value, but when we use variable to link an object, the variable is a address.
   int a = 100;
   Program b= new Program();

hope you can understand what I say
