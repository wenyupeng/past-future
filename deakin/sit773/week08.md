Leckie’s Choice (LC) began as a small business 20 years ago and has grown to have multiple store
locations throughout Victoria. Currently, LC is a distributor, wholesaler and retailer of residential and industrial electrical equipment, supplies and services. The company also provides installation and services in areas such as energy
management, solar systems, home automation, surveillance systems and data and communication
equipment. LC has well trained, knowledgeable staff that understand their customers, through which the business
builds and maintains strong, professional relationships. The company has an informative web site, however, customer orders are mainly dealt with over the phone and e-mail at local branches as the
business website does not support ordering. The owners of the business are transitioning into retirement, leaving their son and daughter, John and
Ruby, in charge. John and Ruby are concerned that the business is not keeping up with the times as
the market is becoming more and more competitive. This is creating a new challenge for the business. Both of them have observed that total quarterly sales have declined. In addition, customer queries have
recently doubled, increasing the workload for LC’s sales staff. Some customers have commented that ordering and delivery take too long and consequently, they’ve
proceeded to purchase products directly from other wholesalers. Customers have also reported that
they are receiving more attractive promotions and loyalty rewards from other wholesalers. John has identified that the current marketing and product promotion policies of LC do not reflect their
customers’ expectations. A new marketing manager has been appointed who is sorting through
feedback left by customers in order to develop plausible promotion policies and customer loyalty
rewards programs. While the new marketing manager is working hard to try and develop these
programs, John understands that the result does not guarantee an increase in customer traffic or
loyalty.

Ruby shares a common view with John. Both of them believe that for the company to remain
competitive, it needs to use technology to its advantage but they are both unsure about how to do this. John and Ruby have approached you, a software engineer, to identify problem areas, make
recommendations and propose solutions that will help to ensure the company stays economically
viable in the future.

# Scope-cost-time triangle
Building software based on specific requirements involves understanding the invisible forces that can impact software projects: scope, cost and time.

As effective as the project team can be, there are forces beyond the team that can require aspects of the solution they are building to be cut, or produced at lower quality than the team is capable of. This can be frustrating for the team when they know they can do better, especially for the systems analyst who worked hard to identify the right solution — but sometimes this cannot be helped.

The universality and enormity of these forces can substantially alter the system that is constructed, which makes awareness of them critical for systems analysts.

## Scope
The Scope of a project is based on the requirements that are agreed upon with the client. This defines what will be included in the project, including the necessary functional and non-functional requirements.

Ideally, the scope should be locked down during the early phases of the software development lifecycle, before development has commenced.

However, in practice clients often do not know what they want until they see something that is not what they want. As a consequence, the scope of a project can easily change and when this continues without check it is referred to as scope cree

## Cost
Cost refers to the budget required for completing the work defined by the scope of the project.

Typically, the cost of a project is fixed and development ceases once the client has run out of money to pay the developers.

Poor upfront requirements analysis can lead to a blow out in costs, for example, additional technical challenges are uncovered that were not budgeted for.

## Time 
Time-to-market is an important concept in software development as it can be the deciding factor as to whether the product is a success or a failure.

Project teams are often under time constraints to meet deadlines imposed by the commercial reality. Common reasons for time pressure include:
Common reasons for time pressure include:
- new features that must be ready for marketing purposes
- the requirements change and ‘lost’ time needs to be recovered
- the project team is downsized or needs to upskill
- poor estimations of the time it takes to complete the work

## Quality
Software quality is difficult to achieve, and understanding the quality requirements for a system requires thorough analysis.

A common challenge to achieving quality is that the quality requirements are often implied, ie everyone expects a mobile app to be fast — but the client may not specify that as a requirement.

It takes significant effort to build quality into a product and often early design decisions influence the final quality.
