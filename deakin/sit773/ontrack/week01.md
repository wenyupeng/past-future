# A brief report outlining the pain points you identified.
1. expend the web site to support order online: The company has an informative web site, however, customer orders are mainly dealt with over the phone and e-mail at local branches as the
   business website does not support ordering.
2. use robot sales to do the simple sales' jobs, release the workload of LC's sales staff: customer queries have
   recently doubled, increasing the workload for LC’s sales staff
3. promote the storage and delivery system, help customers purchase products quickly: Some customers have commented that ordering and delivery take too long and consequently, they’ve
   proceeded to purchase products directly from other wholesalers
4. do some more attractive promotions to improve customer's loyal: Customers have also reported that
   they are receiving more attractive promotions and loyalty rewards from other wholesalers

# Your problem statement based on the provided case study


as your learned in week1  content, you can identify the stakeholders by discussing and answering the following 
questions:
1. Who is interacting with the system? 
    - customers, sales staff, marketing manager
2. Who is the customer for the system?
   - who will purchase productions
3. who will be affected by the system's outputs?
    - customers, sales staff, marketing manager, John, Ruby
4. Who will maintain the operate the system?
    - sales staff, marketing manager, software engineer
5. Who is responsible for evaluating and approving the system?
    - marketing manager and software engineer

in this activity you need to write a problem statement for your selected scenario. follow the following steps:
1. Analyse the users pain points and ensure that their concerns are accurate.
   - The company has an informative web site, however, customer orders are mainly dealt with over the phone and e-mail at local branches as the business website does not support ordering.
   - customer queries have recently doubled, increasing the workload for LC’s sales staff
   - Some customers have commented that ordering and delivery take too long and consequently, they’ve proceeded to purchase products directly from other wholesalers
   - Customers have also reported that they are receiving more attractive promotions and loyalty rewards from other wholesalers
2. identify the root causes of these problems.
    - order system reacts slowly;
    - no system to handle customer queries;
    - storage and delivery system can not satisfy customer's requests;
    - not enough promotion to maintain customer loyalty
3. know your audience, the stakeholders who will read your statement. you need to be able to convince them that the problem has to be solved.
4. write your problem statement. include the key details of the problem.

In this week’s learning activities, you have explored domain vocabulary and domain analysis. Domain
vocabulary provides you with the terminologies used in the problem domain, its context and the
environment.
In the previous task, you were required to write a problem statement. A problem statement may not
reflect the sources of, or root causes of the issues. In this task you will apply what you have learned
this week on domain analysis so that you can identify the root causes of these issues and understand
the problem domain thoroughly in order to propose the best solution for your stakeholders.
As you’ve learned, one of the major problems for LC is that sales and return on investment (ROI) are
decreasing. LC needs to overcome these problems as soon as possible, while maintaining customer
loyalty and attracting new customers in this very competitive market. However, at this stage, ROI is the
main problem that LC is faced with but the problem itself does not define a reasonable solution.
Fishbone diagrams, which have been explained this week, are used in order to identify the underlying
causes of a problem.
In this task, you are required to perform domain analysis and identify the root causes of LC’s problem
based on the information provided in the case study, described in the previous task, by constructing a
fishbone diagram.
