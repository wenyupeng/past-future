# Use case
A use case describes a set of possible sequences an actor goes through while interacting with the system to achieve a specific and singular goal.
In contrast to usage scenarios, use cases focus less on the needs and motivations of users and more on how the system will be used.
By refining use cases, the logic of the low-level tasks the system must perform can be determined.
