Abstract
Relational databases have long been the dominant technology for managing structured data, primarily due to their reliability, consistency, and efficiency in transactional operations. They are based on the principles of the relational model developed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970, which revolutionized the way data was stored, accessed, and managed. The model organizes data into tables (or relations) with predefined schemas, ensuring that relationships between different data points are clearly defined and that the data remains consistent and accurate. This approach quickly became indispensable in industries where data accuracy and consistency are paramount, such as banking, finance, and large enterprise systems. In these environments, the ability to maintain strict control over data integrity, enforce complex relationships, and execute transactions reliably made relational databases the go-to choice.
However, the rise of big data, cloud computing, and the need for scalable distributed systems exposed limitations in relational databases. Chen et al. (2018) found that processing times on blockchain networks were significantly slower than MySQL, and relational databases struggle with unstructured or semi-structured data. Moreover, their vertical scaling architecture requires more powerful hardware, making them less efficient for large-scale, real-time data processing.
In response, NoSQL databases emerged as a viable alternative, addressing the challenges faced by traditional systems. With flexible data models, horizontal scalability, and the ability to handle diverse data types, NoSQL databases cater to the needs of modern applications. This essay will explore the limitations of relational databases, introduce NoSQL, and discuss how NoSQL addresses these issues, along with its pros and cons.

Introduction
NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed to handle large volumes of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data. They offer flexibility in data storage and retrieval, making them well-suited for scenarios where traditional relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) might struggle. NoSQL databases are particularly useful for big data, real-time web applications, and distributed systems.

There are four primary types of NoSQL databases, each suited to different types of data and use cases. Document stores, such as MongoDB and CouchDB, store data in the form of documents, typically in formats like JSON or BSON. This allows for flexible, nested data structures that are easy to modify and scale. Key-value stores, such as Redis and Amazon DynamoDB, use a simple key-value pair model, excelling in performance and scalability for applications that require fast read and write operations. Column-family stores, like Apache Cassandra and HBase, organize data into columns rather than rows, optimizing performance for large-scale distributed systems and real-time analytics. Lastly, graph databases, such as Neo4j, store data in a graph structure, making them ideal for applications that involve complex relationships between data points, such as social networks or recommendation engines.


Relational databases, while long considered the standard for managing structured data, face growing limitations in the modern data landscape. Built around a rigid schema, relational databases store data in rows and columns, which makes them highly effective for structured data with clearly defined relationships. However, this same structure becomes a significant drawback when dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data, such as images, videos, or social media interactions. Relational databases rely on predefined schemas, meaning that any changes to the data structure require costly modifications. This inflexibility hinders their adaptability in scenarios where the data format frequently evolves or is not well-defined at the outset. Additionally, relational databases rely primarily on vertical scaling, meaning they require more powerful hardware to handle increased loads, which can be both expensive and inefficient when applied to large-scale, distributed systems.

Relational databases, while long considered the standard for managing structured data, face growing limitations in the modern data landscape. Built around a rigid schema, relational databases store data in rows and columns, which makes them highly effective for structured data with clearly defined relationships. However, according to Nishtha et.al(2012), relational databases make use of SQL, which is featured to work on structured data, but SQL can be highly complex when working with unstructured data. This same structure becomes a significant drawback when dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data, such as images, videos, or social media interactions. 


Relational databases, built on the traditional RDBMS model, are well-suited for structured data but struggle when dealing with large-scale, unstructured datasets. Base on the research done by WONDWESSEN HAILE ADDAL, scaling relational databases has been done vertically, by adding more resources like CPU and memory to a single machine. However, this approach has its limits and becomes costly as data demands grow. To achieve scalability, relational databases often require redundant copies of data, which introduces challenges in maintaining consistency and managing the system (Kolonko Kamil 2018). Horizontal scaling, which involves adding more nodes to the system, is even more complex in relational databases, as it can create difficulties in handling transaction processing and maintaining data consistency across distributed nodes. These limitations make it harder for traditional relational databases to adapt to modern, large-scale, and highly dynamic data environments.

Relational databases often struggle with performance when compared to NoSQL databases, particularly in handling large-scale, unstructured, or highly dynamic data. The rigid schema and high level of abstraction in relational databases can slow down query processing, especially for complex queries or operations requiring frequent schema changes. According to the study of Petri et.al in 2022, the performance of MySQL 5.1.41 was too poor for complex queries. Additionally, relational databases face challenges when distributed across multiple nodes, often leading to operational inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks in cloud environments (Litchfield et.al 2017).

MySQL, for instance, has been shown to perform poorly in such cases, while NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Cassandra excel in providing flexibility and speed for complex data models. Additionally, relational databases face challenges when distributed across multiple nodes, often leading to operational inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks in cloud environments. In contrast, NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, handling massive amounts of data across distributed systems more effectively, making them a better choice for modern applications that require speed, flexibility, and scalability.

Performance of Graph and Relational Databases in Complex Queries by Petri Kotiranta 2022, the performance of MySQL 5.1.41 was too poor for complex queries.
A performance comparison of object and relational databases using the Sun Benchmark, Joshua Duhl 1988,mentions that the high level of abstraction in relational databases can lead to poor performance.
Survey of Performance Comparison Based on Non Relational Database，Jingbo Li 2021,non-relational databases can pay a "huge price" in terms of reading and writing performance.
Distributed Relational Database Performance in Cloud Computing: an Investigative Study,Litchfield, A 2017, indicates that distributed relational databases in the cloud can have operational disadvantages and performance issues.

As the volume and variety of data continue to grow, along with the need for real-time processing, the limitations of relational databases have become more pronounced. NoSQL databases emerged as a solution to these challenges, offering flexibility, scalability, and high performance, especially for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike relational databases, NoSQL systems do not require a fixed schema, allowing them to easily accommodate changing data structures. In the study of Azad et al.(2020), This flexibility makes them particularly well-suited for applications like content management, social media, and Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where the data is often unstructured or semi-structured and may evolve over time.

NoSQL databases offer significant advantages when it comes to scalability. While relational databases primarily scale vertically by upgrading hardware, NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, distributing data across multiple servers or nodes. This means that as the system grows, additional servers can be added, enabling the system to handle larger datasets and higher traffic volumes without significant performance degradation. This capability makes NoSQL databases an excellent choice for big data applications and real-time analytics, where massive amounts of data need to be processed and accessed quickly (Mishra et al. 2017).



Another key strength of NoSQL databases is their ability to optimize read and write operations, particularly in environments with high-velocity data. For applications like e-commerce platforms, social media networks, or real-time gaming, the speed at which data can be read or written to the database is crucial for maintaining performance. NoSQL databases are often designed with this in mind, providing low-latency access to data and enabling fast, efficient data retrieval.

NoSQL databases also follow the CAP theorem, which posits that distributed systems can only guarantee two out of three properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Most NoSQL systems prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency, making them highly reliable in distributed environments where server failures or network issues may occur. This design ensures that data remains accessible even in the event of partial system failures, making NoSQL a robust choice for applications requiring high availability and fault tolerance.

There are four primary types of NoSQL databases, each suited to different types of data and use cases. Document stores, such as MongoDB and CouchDB, store data in the form of documents, typically in formats like JSON or BSON. This allows for flexible, nested data structures that are easy to modify and scale. Key-value stores, such as Redis and Amazon DynamoDB, use a simple key-value pair model, excelling in performance and scalability for applications that require fast read and write operations. Column-family stores, like Apache Cassandra and HBase, organize data into columns rather than rows, optimizing performance for large-scale distributed systems and real-time analytics. Lastly, graph databases, such as Neo4j, store data in a graph structure, making them ideal for applications that involve complex relationships between data points, such as social networks or recommendation engines.

NoSQL databases’ types
Document Stores
Document stores, such as MongoDB and CouchDB, are a type of NoSQL database that store data as individual documents. These documents are typically in formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or BSON (Binary JSON), which provide a flexible and schema-less structure. Unlike relational databases that require predefined table schemas, document stores allow for the storage of complex, nested data, making them ideal for applications where data structure may evolve over time or where the data is inherently unstructured. According to the study by Wang et al. (2020), a schema suggestion model for NoSQL document-store databases to address the challenges in modelling these flexible databases. Each document in a document store represents a self-contained unit of data and can vary in structure from other documents, offering significant flexibility. This makes document stores particularly useful for applications such as content management systems, catalogues, and user profiles, where each document may have unique attributes.
Moreover, document stores allow for easy scaling and high performance, especially for read-heavy or write-heavy workloads. MongoDB, for example, is optimized for handling large volumes of data and can distribute documents across multiple servers, ensuring both scalability and availability in distributed environments. This flexibility and adaptability to real-time data needs have made document stores a popular choice for modern applications.

Key-Value Stores
Key-value stores are a type of NoSQL database that uses a simple key-value pair model to store data. In this model, each piece of data is associated with a unique key, allowing for quick lookups and retrieval. The simplicity of this structure makes key-value stores highly performant and scalable, particularly for applications that require fast read and write operations. Because there is no need for complex data relationships or joins, key-value stores are ideal for use cases like caching, session management, and real-time analytics, where speed and efficiency are critical. Popular key-value databases, such as Redis and Amazon DynamoDB, can handle large volumes of data and transactions at high speed, distributing data across multiple nodes for improved scalability.
The design of key-value stores allows for straightforward horizontal scaling, meaning they can easily expand to accommodate growing data by adding more servers. This makes them especially useful in environments where fast access to data is a priority and the structure of the data is relatively simple.

Column-Family Stores
Column-family stores, a type of NoSQL database, organize data into columns rather than traditional rows, optimizing performance for large-scale distributed systems and real-time analytics. Instead of storing data in a row-oriented format like relational databases, column-family stores group data by columns, which allows for more efficient querying and data retrieval, especially when only certain columns need to be accessed (Counte E and Cuza C.m 2018). This structure is particularly useful for applications dealing with massive amounts of data, such as log analysis, recommendation engines, and data warehousing. By storing related data together in columns, these databases can quickly retrieve specific attributes without having to scan entire rows, significantly improving query performance.
Base on the study of Sheth V 2023, Comparative performance analysis has shown that column-family databases, like Cassandra and HBase, can offer better performance than traditional relational databases for certain types of workloads, particularly those involving large-scale data storage and retrieval. They can efficiently distribute data across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. This makes them well-suited for systems that need to process and analyse real-time data streams or large datasets across multiple nodes. Additionally, the columnar format is beneficial for data compression, further enhancing performance and storage efficiency.

These databases efficiently distribute data across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance, making them ideal for systems processing real-time data streams or large datasets. Additionally, the columnar format supports data compression, further improving performance and storage efficiency.

Graph Databases
Graph databases are a type of NoSQL database designed to store and manage data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), making them particularly well-suited for handling complex and interconnected data. Unlike relational databases that rely on tables and predefined relationships, graph databases use graph structures to represent and query relationships dynamically, allowing for more efficient processing of data with complex interconnections (Pokorný 2015). In a graph database, data is modelled as a collection of nodes, which represent entities such as people, products, or places, and edges, which represent relationships between these nodes. Each node and edge can hold properties, providing detailed information about the entities and their connections. This structure makes it easy to model real-world relationships and navigate through them quickly, offering a highly intuitive way to represent complex data patterns. One of the key strengths of graph databases is their ability to efficiently handle queries involving relationships and connections, which are often cumbersome and inefficient in traditional relational databases. In applications like social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and supply chain management, relationships between entities are central to the functionality. For example, in a social network, users are connected through various types of relationships such as friendships, likes, or follows. Graph databases allow for the quick traversal of these connections, making it easier to answer queries like "Who are the mutual friends of two users?" or "Which products are often bought together?"

The performance of graph databases shines in scenarios where relationships need to be explored deeply and in real-time. Since the database structure is optimized for relationship-based queries, traversing through connected data is faster and more efficient compared to relational databases, where such queries would involve multiple table joins and could become computationally expensive as the dataset grows. Popular graph databases like Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, and ArangoDB have become essential tools for industries that rely on complex data networks. In addition to social networks and recommendations, graph databases are widely used in areas like knowledge management, where intricate relationships between data points must be stored and queried. They are also useful in fraud detection, where entities such as financial transactions, users, and accounts can be connected in a graph to detect suspicious patterns of behaviours.
Graph databases provide flexibility in data modelling, as new nodes and relationships can be added without the need for schema changes or reconfiguration. This adaptability makes graph databases an excellent choice for systems that evolve over time and require continuous updates to their relationships.
In conclusion, graph databases excel in managing and querying complex, interconnected data. By representing data as nodes and relationships, they provide a powerful and intuitive way to model and explore connections. Their high performance in handling relationship-based queries makes them invaluable for applications ranging from social networking and recommendation systems to fraud detection and knowledge management, making them a critical tool in modern data management.

Advantages of NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases offer several significant advantages over traditional relational databases, particularly in modern applications managing large-scale data. A key benefit is scalability—NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling, enabling them to handle massive datasets and high traffic across distributed systems, making them ideal for cloud environments. Their flexibility is another major asset; without the constraints of a rigid schema, NoSQL databases can easily accommodate unstructured and semi-structured data, adapting to evolving requirements and diverse data formats. High performance is also a notable advantage, as NoSQL systems are optimized for fast read and write operations, especially in scenarios where complex joins and transactions are unnecessary. Additionally, NoSQL databases tend to be more cost-effective, as they can scale horizontally using commodity hardware, avoiding the need for the expensive, high-performance servers that relational databases require for vertical scaling. These features collectively make NoSQL databases a compelling choice for modern, data-intensive applications.
---
Disadvantages of NoSQL Databases
Despite their advantages, NoSQL databases come with certain drawbacks that warrant careful consideration. One significant limitation is the lack of full ACID transaction support. Many NoSQL databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency, as per the CAP theorem, which can be problematic for applications requiring strong consistency guarantees. Additionally, NoSQL databases often have more limited query capabilities compared to relational databases. While SQL offers powerful, standardized query options, querying in NoSQL systems can be more complex, especially across multiple nodes or collections, often necessitating custom programming solutions.
Another challenge is data duplication, as NoSQL databases prioritize performance over strict normalization. This can lead to redundant data storage across various documents or collections, increasing storage requirements and causing potential consistency issues during updates. Lastly, while NoSQL databases have grown in popularity, they are relatively newer compared to relational databases, often lacking the same level of maturity, robust tooling, and community support. This can be particularly limiting for applications with complex analytical needs or those relying on well-established ecosystems. Despite these challenges, understanding these limitations helps in making informed decisions when choosing the right database for specific use cases.

NoSQL databases, such as document-oriented or key-value stores, typically denormalize data to achieve higher performance. This denormalization can lead to data duplication across different documents or collections, increasing the overall storage requirements.

conclusion
In conclusion, while relational databases have long dominated the field of structured data management due to their reliability and well-defined schemas, they face increasing challenges in today’s data landscape. The emergence of NoSQL databases offers a flexible, scalable, and high-performance alternative for handling unstructured and semi-structured data, particularly in applications requiring real-time processing and distributed systems. With various types, including document stores, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases, NoSQL provides tailored solutions for different data needs. However, despite their advantages in scalability and adaptability, NoSQL systems come with trade-offs, such as limited ACID transaction support and potential data redundancy. Therefore, the choice between relational and NoSQL databases should be based on specific application requirements, balancing the need for flexibility, performance, and consistency.

Slide 1: Introduction to NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases offer an alternative to traditional relational databases.
Designed to handle challenges related to massive data sets, complex structures, and high-volume operations.

Hello everyone! Today we’re diving into NoSQL databases. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL is designed to tackle the challenges of handling massive data sets, complex data structures, and high-volume operations. For example, databases like MongoDB and Cassandra are used to manage the enormous amounts of data generated by social media platforms and user interactions

---
Slide 2: Why Do We Need NoSQL Databases?
Traditional relational databases are widely used but struggle with scalability, flexibility, and performance when managing large, unstructured, or rapidly changing data.

So, why do we need NoSQL databases? Traditional relational databases, such as MySQL, often struggle with scalability, flexibility, and performance. Take Facebook, for instance; managing its massive user data and dynamic content can overwhelm traditional databases. NoSQL databases provide a better solution for these challenges, offering the flexibility and scalability needed to handle large-scale, evolving data.

Slide 3: Limitations of Relational Databases
Poor Scalability: Performance bottlenecks as data volumes grow.
Limited Flexibility: Rigid schemas make it difficult to adapt to new data structures.
Performance Bottlenecks: Complex queries slow down response times.
Complex Management: Requires specialized expertise and time to maintain.

Let’s start by exploring some limitations of relational databases. First, scalability issues—databases like MySQL can become slow and inefficient as data volumes grow. For example, handling big data in a traditional database can lead to significant performance bottlenecks. Second, flexibility is limited; relational databases require predefined schemas, which can be a problem when adding new types of data. Instagram, for example, had to deal with schema changes to accommodate new data types like short videos. Additionally, complex queries and joins can lead to performance bottlenecks, and managing these databases requires specialized skills, like those needed for maintaining Oracle databases.

Slide 4: Benefits of NoSQL Databases
Strong Flexibility: Supports schema-less designs and adapts to changing data.
High Scalability: Handles massive data volumes with horizontal scaling.
High Performance: Optimized for fast data retrieval and writing operations.

So how do NoSQL databases address these issues? They offer strong flexibility; for example, MongoDB uses schema-less JSON documents, which makes it easy for sites like Reddit to adapt to various types of content. NoSQL databases also provide high scalability—for instance, Cassandra can handle massive amounts of data through horizontal scaling, which helps Netflix manage data for millions of users. Moreover, NoSQL databases focus on high performance; Redis, for instance, allows fast data retrieval, which is crucial for real-time updates on platforms like Twitter.

When the database wants to expand capacity, it is very expensive for relational databases to upgrade, because scaling relational databases has been done vertically, by adding more resources like CPU and memory to a single machine.

Key-Value Stores: Use key-value pairs for high-performance operations.
Graph Databases: Model relationships between data entities for complex queries.
Column-Family Databases: Store data in columns for optimized attribute-specific queries.

NoSQL databases come in several types, each suited to different needs. Document databases like MongoDB are great for semi-structured data, as seen with eBay’s product catalog. Key-value stores such as Redis excel in high-performance scenarios, like managing shopping carts for Amazon. Graph databases, like Neo4j, are used for analyzing complex relationships, such as LinkedIn’s user connections. Column-family databases, like Cassandra, optimize storage and queries for specific data attributes, which is useful for real-time messaging in Facebook Messenger

Slide 6: Use Cases for NoSQL Databases
Best suited for applications handling large amounts of data, rapid data growth, and complex data relationships.

NoSQL databases are particularly effective for applications involving large data volumes, rapid data growth, and complex relationships. For instance, Google uses NoSQL databases to handle vast amounts of user-generated content. Uber and Airbnb rely on NoSQL for real-time processing of user activities and transactions, meeting the demands of their fast-paced environments.

Slide 8: Limitations of NoSQL Databases
Data Consistency: Often sacrifices strong consistency for availability.
Data Modeling: Requires careful planning for effective schema design.
Query Capabilities: Limited complex querying compared to SQL.
Transaction Management: Lacks robust transaction management features of relational databases.

However, NoSQL databases do come with some limitations. Data consistency can be an issue; for example, Cassandra offers eventual consistency rather than strong consistency, which might lead to temporary data mismatches. Data modeling can be more complex compared to relational databases, and query capabilities are often more limited, which can be challenging for complex analytics. Additionally, transaction management lacks the robust ACID features of relational databases, potentially impacting data integrity in complex operations.
