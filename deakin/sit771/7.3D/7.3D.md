Hi, in this video, I'll introduce my custom project related to the 7.3D task.

Let's take a look at the UML class diagram. 
First of all, the entry point of the project is the Program class, which delegates important tasks to the Panel class. 
The Panel class handles user input and draws the game interface, including blocks, player lives, and enemy tanks. The Player and Enemy classes both inherit from the Tank class.

In this game, tanks cannot overlap other pixels. The player earns points by destroying enemy tanks, with one point awarded per tank destroyed. Every ten points, the player levels up. The number of enemy tanks is controlled by the initial count (which is 5) and the current level, but the maximum number of enemy tanks is capped at 15.

The Player and Enemy classes have dependency relationships with the Block and Bullet classes. When the player's tank or enemy tanks move, they must check for collisions with other pixels. Additionally, the player's tank can fire up to three bullets on the screen, while enemy tanks can only fire one bullet at a time.

There are still many details I haven't mentioned yet. Let's take a look at the actual project and see how it runs.
