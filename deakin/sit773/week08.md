Leckie’s Choice (LC) began as a small business 20 years ago and has grown to have multiple store
locations throughout Victoria. Currently, LC is a distributor, wholesaler and retailer of residential and industrial electrical equipment, supplies and services. The company also provides installation and services in areas such as energy
management, solar systems, home automation, surveillance systems and data and communication
equipment. LC has well trained, knowledgeable staff that understand their customers, through which the business
builds and maintains strong, professional relationships. The company has an informative web site, however, customer orders are mainly dealt with over the phone and e-mail at local branches as the
business website does not support ordering. The owners of the business are transitioning into retirement, leaving their son and daughter, John and
Ruby, in charge. John and Ruby are concerned that the business is not keeping up with the times as
the market is becoming more and more competitive. This is creating a new challenge for the business. Both of them have observed that total quarterly sales have declined. In addition, customer queries have
recently doubled, increasing the workload for LC’s sales staff. Some customers have commented that ordering and delivery take too long and consequently, they’ve
proceeded to purchase products directly from other wholesalers. Customers have also reported that
they are receiving more attractive promotions and loyalty rewards from other wholesalers. John has identified that the current marketing and product promotion policies of LC do not reflect their
customers’ expectations. A new marketing manager has been appointed who is sorting through
feedback left by customers in order to develop plausible promotion policies and customer loyalty
rewards programs. While the new marketing manager is working hard to try and develop these
programs, John understands that the result does not guarantee an increase in customer traffic or
loyalty.

Ruby shares a common view with John. Both of them believe that for the company to remain
competitive, it needs to use technology to its advantage but they are both unsure about how to do this. John and Ruby have approached you, a software engineer, to identify problem areas, make
recommendations and propose solutions that will help to ensure the company stays economically
viable in the future.
