# Modelling techniques
There are many modelling techniques that can assist a systems analyst to identify requirements, constraints and conditions of system features.

## Personas
Personas are a technique for creating fictional example users to better understand what they need from the software.
At a high-level, the creation of personas helps you empathise with the users of the system and anticipate their needs in processes that the system supports or enables.

## User stories
User stories extend the modelling performed using personas by describing specific things personas want to do with the system.
User stories outline the high level actions the system can perform for personas, which helps to identify the constraints and conditions of system features.

## Usage scenarios
Usage scenarios describe how a user interacts with a system to achieve a goal. They can be high-level or low-level, depending on the needs of the systems analyst.
They are narrative descriptions that outline what happens during the user-system interaction, but do not describe how the interaction takes place.

## Use cases
Use cases determine how a system’s feature will work. In contrast to usage scenarios, use cases focus less on the needs and motivations of users and more on how the system will be used. By refining use cases, the logic of the low-level tasks the system must perform can be determined.

## Mockups and prototypes
Mockups and prototypes are simple representations or simulations of the system that can be used to gain insight into how users might actually perform use cases.

Modelling is generally only used to identify functional requirements


# What are actors and personas?
In requirements modelling, actors represent the roles that users, and even other systems, can take with respect to the system, while personas describe specific types of users to help bring the idea to life.

Personas and actors are a type of requirements model, both used by designers, developers, project participants, and others when designing products, IT systems, and services.

## Actors
An actor is the description of a role within a system. For example, a lecturer and a student are different actors within the university system.

Actors provide an abstraction to the different levels of user roles and personalities, making them easier to work with.

## Personas
A persona is the description of a fictitious user, who does not exist as a specific person but who is described in such a way that the reader can relate to the description and believe that the user could exist in reality.

# What are user stories?
User stories capture discrete requirements based on the perspective of the end user.
User stories help convey the different stakeholders’ needs.

format:
> As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [reason].

The persona ensures that you’re thinking about the actual people who will use this feature. If there is no identifiable persona or type of user, you should reconsider whether you need this story.
The action describes what will happen, but not how it is to happen. How the action or goal is achieved is outlined in the corresponding use case. Use cases are explored in the next activity.
The reason describes the purpose of this feature, depicting why the user wants to do this thing with the software. Again, if you cannot provide a reason, you should reconsider whether the feature is actually important.

example:
~~~
As a customer, I want to purchase multiple products at once, so that I can pay in a single transaction.

As a financial officer, I want to download the last 6 months of purchase transactions as PDF reports, so that I can reconcile our financial accounts.

As a student, I want to access the course materials online, so that I can complete my assessment tasks anywhere.

# Creating user stories
User stories are simple enough that people can learn to write them in a few minutes. Get stakeholders together with pen and paper writing simple statements on what the personas defined for the project will need the software to do and why.

## Begin with epics
Before jumping into writing your user stories, start thinking about epics first.

An epic is a larger story which describes the bigger-picture product features that are to be broken up into your user stories.

You can think of epics as a rough scope of the work your feature will perform, which helps avoid duplication and inconsistencies among user stories.

## Get together with pen and paper
Meet with all stakeholders to work collaboratively on the user stories.

Simple tools such as sheets of paper, paper cards, or large post-it notes are easy to use and facilitate collaboration.
## Put your personas to use
In a previous topic, you learned how to define the different personas that are expected to use your software.

Each persona will have a defined goal they want to achieve or problem they want solved by the software.

Ask yourself what functionality the product should provide to meet the goals of each persona to create user stories.
## Keep it simple
Refine this statement using the who, what and why template, so that you end up with a clear, concise, feasible and testable user story.

> As a customer, I want to purchase food online, so that it can be delivered to my home

## Indicate priority
To help plan iterations of work, it is vital to communicate the importance of specific product features to the development team. This can be done by adding a priority to each user story.

There is no single best method to do this, but stick with a consistent strategy that works for the project team. Some tips on indicating priority will be covered in the next topic.
