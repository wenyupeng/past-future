Rob Brown is an outdoor adventure specialist with good expertise in outdoor apparel (clothing and
shoes) for trekking, hiking and skiing. Rob works in Retail, Marketing and Sustainable Fashion for a
large clothing line, and is conscious that the clothing industry needs to focus more on sustainability
and recycling of good second-hand clothing items and outdoor gear. In addition, Rob is conscious of
how expensive new outdoor sports clothing and gear have become and feels there is a market for
second-hand items. Rob has been toying with the idea of creating an online platform to sell second-
hand outdoor apparel and gear. He knows, from his own experience in Retail and Fashion, that
sports stores often need to get rid of the season’s last stock which can easily be sold ‘as-if’ new via
an online platform at reduced prices.

Jim Green, a friend of Rob’s, is currently working as merchandising and brand manager for a large
Australian sports chain. Jim envisions leveraging technology to create a solution to the recycling
problem. He shares Rob’s sentiments to target this problem through a digital platform that sells
second-hand gear and apparel. Both Rob and Jim have experience of student trips and adventures
organised by clubs and societies of their respective alma maters. They know there is a big second
student market for students going on outdoor trips. While Rob brings expertise in fit-for-purpose
types of outdoor apparel and business acumen in the retail sector, Jim brings a strategic mindset
driven by his passion for entrepreneurship and expertise in business development. With a strong
understanding of consumer behaviour and market dynamics, Jim recognises the potential of bridging
the gap between outdoor apparel and brands through technology. He believes that his business skills
complement Rob’s background in retail and marketing. Rob and Jim both feel strongly about
sustainability through affordability and decided to combine their entrepreneurial skills to start the
recycling venture/project ‘Sustainable Outdoor Co.’. They believe this is an opportunity to leverage
technology and data-driven strategies to create a platform that will become a transformative force
in the online sustainable recycling of second-hand Outdoor apparel and gear.

Recognising the lack of online outdoor apparel recycling sales platforms, Rob and Jim set out to
create Sustainable Outdoor Co. to provide second-hand buyers and donators of clothing and sporting
equipment with a unique and tailored experience. The platform will draw on the latest
advancements in technology, such as AI algorithms to suggest the best combination of outdoor
apparel (clothing sets, shoes and gear) for the type of outdoor activity customers plan to undertake.
In addition, customers will also be able to donate items for selling these, using a ‘points-system’.
Successful donations will accrue points that donors of quality clothing can use to buy second-hand
items advertised on the platform.

Rob and Jim firmly believe that Sustainable Outdoor Co has the potential to revolutionise the online
recycling of second-hand outdoor retail apparel and gear industry. They envision a platform that
seamlessly combines outdoor apparel and gear expertise, advanced technology, and a vibrant
community that supports the recycling idea. They aspire that Sustainable Outdoor Co. will become
popular amongst student clubs and societies, and other groups interested in recycling second-hand
clothing and gear, by offering a comprehensive catalogue of these outdoor items from well-known brands, providing users
with the ability to effortlessly explore, discover, and find outdoor items that fit a buyer’s personal style.
With a strong focus on customer satisfaction, Sustainable Outdoor Co. aims to create a seamless
shopping experience that allows customers (or users) to find outdoor apparel and gear that they
need, receive personalised suggestions of these items, and allow like-minded customers to engage
by sharing information and recommend types and suggestions of apparel and gear. Rob and Jim are
confident that Sustainable Outdoor Co. will become popular in the second-hand market, especially
for customers who value recycling and affordability.

By prioritising user-centric design, and cutting-edge technology, Rob and Jim are determined to
launch Sustainable Outdoor Co. as a revolutionary online retail fashion application that sets new
standards for the second-hand apparel and recycling industry.
