a. What are the risks faced by self-driving systems?
Self-driving systems like AutoDrive face multiple risks, particularly around safety, technology, cybersecurity, ethics, and compliance. Safety risks arise from the potential for misinterpreting road conditions, which could lead to collisions or accidents, especially under adverse weather or lighting conditions. Technology risks include potential sensor malfunctions or software bugs, which could impair the vehicle’s decision-making in real time. Cybersecurity risks emerge from the possibility of hacking or system breaches that could give unauthorized access to control the vehicle. Ethical dilemmas, such as how an AI system should respond when faced with unavoidable accidents, also present significant challenges. Lastly, legal and regulatory risks come into play, as self-driving cars need to adhere to various traffic laws that differ across jurisdictions. Failure to manage these risks could result in operational failure, legal liabilities, or accidents that undermine public trust in autonomous driving technologies.

b. How do you analyze and classify these risks?
To analyze and classify the risks associated with self-driving systems, tools like Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) are used. FMEA helps identify potential failures in system components, assigning priority based on the severity and likelihood of each failure. Fault Tree Analysis visually maps out the causes of failures, breaking down complex systems into individual components to understand how a failure in one could impact the entire system. Risks are classified based on their potential impact: high, medium, or low. For example, safety risks and technology failures are high-priority as they directly affect user safety, while cybersecurity threats might be classified as medium due to their preventative measures but could escalate based on vulnerability. Regulatory risks tend to be lower in impact but still need monitoring for compliance. This classification enables targeted mitigation strategies for each risk type.

c. How do you identify the potential root causes of each identified risk?
Identifying the root causes of risks in self-driving systems involves both data analysis and testing. Safety risks, for example, can be traced to sensor malfunctions or misinterpretations by reviewing accident data from autonomous vehicles. In-depth analysis of system logs and performance data can identify recurring failures in components, such as sensors or processing units. For cybersecurity risks, penetration testing and threat modeling are employed to pinpoint vulnerabilities in communication protocols and onboard systems. Ethical risks can be explored through simulated driving scenarios where the AI is placed in challenging decision-making environments, revealing flaws in ethical algorithms. Regulatory risks are identified by comparing the system's operation against local and international traffic laws, detecting non-compliant behavior. By identifying the root causes, developers can create robust strategies to address these issues before they escalate into larger problems that could compromise the system’s overall functionality and safety.

d. How will you eliminate and reduce those risks?
Reducing and eliminating risks in self-driving systems requires a combination of technological improvements and procedural safeguards. For safety risks, adding redundant sensors such as LIDAR, radar, and cameras ensures more reliable environmental data by cross-verifying information from multiple sources. For technology failure risks, real-time diagnostics that monitor sensor and component health can detect issues before they lead to critical system failures, allowing the system to revert to safe driving modes. Cybersecurity risks can be addressed by implementing end-to-end encryption and real-time threat detection systems, which protect the vehicle from hacking and unauthorized control. To handle ethical risks, AI algorithms must be embedded with moral guidelines and undergo rigorous simulation testing in ethically complex scenarios. Regulatory risks can be managed by incorporating regular software updates that ensure compliance with changing traffic laws and standards, as well as allowing manual control for human intervention in emergencies.

e. Translate additional requirement specifications from your analysis that will mitigate the risks or defend the risks
The additional requirement specifications derived from the risk analysis ensure that the self-driving system operates securely and efficiently. For safety risks, the system should use multi-sensor data integration, enabling it to cross-verify information from LIDAR, radar, and cameras to ensure accurate environment detection. Rationale: Redundancy ensures fewer chances for sensor failure and improves reliability. For technological failure risks, the system must include a real-time diagnostic tool that can automatically detect issues and switch to a fail-safe driving mode. Rationale: This prevents sudden malfunctions from compromising safety. To mitigate cybersecurity threats, the system should utilize end-to-end encryption for all vehicle communications and incorporate regular security patches. Rationale: This protects against unauthorized access and potential cyberattacks. For ethical risks, the system must have ethically programmed AI decision-making models. Rationale: Ensuring the AI can navigate moral dilemmas is crucial for public trust and safety in unavoidable accident situations.
