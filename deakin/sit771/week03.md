Control flow statements give you the power to add dynamic behavior to program's code.
Control flow is basically broken up into three things-- sequence, selection, and repetition.

Program logic runs in sequence.
Sequence is the basis for all of the program flow. The statements within a method are executed in order.

Selection, or branching, statements allow to add places in code where a decision is made and one of a number of paths is chosen.

Repetition statements allow to repeat a path a number of times and repeat code a variable a number of times.
